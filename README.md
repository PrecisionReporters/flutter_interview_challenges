# flutter_interview_challenges

Welcome to the Remote Legal Flutter Coding Challenges repository! This collection is designed to help assess and improve the Flutter development skills of interview candidates and new hires. The challenges focus on key areas like UI implementation, state management, animations, creativity, and problem-solving. They are structured to simulate real-world scenarios that a Flutter developer might face, making them ideal for evaluating both foundational knowledge and practical expertise.

## Getting Started
Please make sure Flutter is installed to your local machine. Then clone the repository. We recommend using VSCode for these challenges.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/PrecisionReporters/flutter_interview_challenges.git
```

To switch between each challenge, modify the `main.dart` challenge Widget. It starts at `ChallengeZero()` which contains some helpful information for getting started.
